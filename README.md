# Spotify--Pipeline

You have to store your api credentials as airflow variables to access the api fetch code with the following parameters:
CLIENT_ID = "The client id which you get for the spotify application you create" CLIENT_SECRET = "The client secret which you get for the spotify application you create".

And on the folder gcp_creds you have to store your GCP projects json file as "my-gcp-service-account.json".
